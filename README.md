# TombX

### About

TombX is an open source re-implmentation of Tomb Raider 1.

### Running

I've only ran TombX with the [Automated Fix](https://github.com/Carlmundo/TombRaider-AutomatedFix/releases/tag/release). To run the game replace `tombati.exe` and add the `TombX.dll` supplied. The game currently only boots up and keyboard input currently isn't working.
